# AskAll: Knowledge, just an SMS away

**AskAll** is a revolutionary platform designed to provide Africans with instant access to Gemini AI through SMS text, overcoming the barriers of poor internet connectivity and limited access to information and communication technology (ICT) tools. Our mission is to empower individuals and communities by delivering valuable information and insights directly to their mobile phones, no internet required.

### Why AskAll?

- **Wide Accessibility**: In Africa, only 43% of the population had internet access in 2021, compared to the global average of 66%. However, mobile phone usage is rapidly increasing, with 489 million unique mobile subscribers in 2023. Many of these users rely on basic feature phones, which can send and receive SMS but cannot access the internet or apps like WhatsApp.

- **Feature Phone Compatibility**: According to a Pew Research study, approximately 65% of individuals in the region predominantly use feature phones, while only 15% own smartphones. AskAll is designed to work seamlessly with these feature phones, making advanced AI accessible to everyone.

- **Educational Support**: With a literacy rate of 67.4% among people aged 15 and above in Africa, AskAll can provide critical educational support by answering questions and offering information on a wide range of topics.

- **Healthcare Assistance**: AskAll can be a vital resource for healthcare workers and individuals seeking medical information. By delivering accurate and timely advice, we help improve healthcare outcomes in areas with limited resources.

- **Agricultural Advice**: Farmers can benefit from AskAll by receiving practical advice on crop management, pest control, and other agricultural practices, helping them to increase productivity and sustainability.

### How It Works

1. **Send an SMS**: Text your question to AskAll.
2. **Receive Instant Responses**: Get immediate answers from Gemini AI.
